                    <p>Captain Rockhopper is a pirate who sails the seas on his  ship, The Migrator, in search of adventure, and of course treasure. When he&rsquo;s  not out at sea, he&rsquo;s at home on Club Penguin. He typically returns every couple  of months and brings along rare and special items to sell.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>He built The Migrator and cast off on his first journey  sometime in March 2005. He returned over a year later with many tales to tell  and treasure to sell. He stores his treasure on Rockhopper Island, which he  discovered and named during his year at sea.</p>

            <h3>Can I really meet Rockhopper?</h3>
          <p>Yes! Whenever his ship is docked at the Beach, you may be  lucky enough to meet him. He likes to hang out on his ship. If you don&rsquo;t find  him there, ask around. He is a red penguin who wears the name Rockhopper and has a black beard and  pirate hat. He considers himself a friend to everyone in Club  Penguin and would love to meet you too.</p>
          <h3>Can I travel with Rockhopper?</h3>
          <p> Rockhopper is the captain of his own ship, and except for  the addition of Yarr, he prefers to travel alone. </p>
          <h3>How can I find out more about Rockhopper?</h3>
          Read his journal the next time he is in town. It is located  on the bottom right corner of your screen when you are on board his ship. It is  always docked at the Beach beside the Lighthouse.</blockquote></td>

                  <p> There are a few different ways penguins can contribute to  the Penguin Times newspaper. Every week jokes, poems and riddles submitted by  penguins are published. If you like drawing, you can submit a comic to be  published. There are too many submissions to publish all of them, so only a  selection will be used. To send a joke, poem, riddle or comic go to the last  page of the newspaper and follow the instructions. </p>
