&ldquo;Searching for a positive alternative to the &quot;bad stuff&quot; online I turned to my kids and what I found was Club Penguin&hellip; We (law enforcement personnel) are all approached by parents asking about where their kids are safe in cyberspace and I don't think this trend will change anytime soon. Impress upon them the need for knowing and understanding what their kids are doing online and consider finding and suggesting safe sites like Club Penguin.&rdquo;<br>

&ldquo;I am a Grandmother who is an active member of the club, keeping in touch with six grand-children, (ages 4 to 11) via our penguins! I gave them their subscriptions for Christmas. One of them is in America.  I am in the UK and it is the easiest way I can think of to 'chat'&hellip; It's such fun. Thank you very much.  I am officially COOL!&rdquo; <br>

&ldquo;I just wanted to let you know how awesome your website is. Our 7- year-old son underwent a bone marrow transplant this past November. He and his brother joined Club Penguin before we left for the hospital, so they could play the game together&hellip; We will never forget what Club Penguin has meant to our family during this stressful time.&rdquo; <br>

&ldquo;I want to thank you and the inventors of Club Penguin for the extraordinary opportunity the game has given my 11-year-old son, Nicky, who has Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome. The game has allowed him to practice his social skills and meet other kids through conversation and fun in a non-threatening, non-judgmental environment&hellip;&rdquo;<br>

&ldquo;I have two little penguins who love your site!  My sons are 11 and 6&hellip;  I researched your site carefully and sat with him several times, watching him waddle around your site. I think it is a refreshing alternative from what I've been seeing. I love the &quot;safe mode&quot; feature. I even feel comfortable letting my 6-year-old play&hellip;&rdquo; <br>
