                  <p>Captain Rockhopper is a pirate who sails the seas on his  ship, The Migrator, in search of adventure, and of course treasure. When he&rsquo;s  not out at sea, he&rsquo;s at home on Club Penguin. He typically returns every couple  of months and brings along rare and special items to sell.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>He built The Migrator and cast off on his first journey  sometime in March 2005. He returned over a year later with many tales to tell  and treasure to sell. He stores his treasure on Rockhopper Island, which he  discovered and named during his year at sea.</p>

If you don&rsquo;t find  him there, ask around. He is a red penguin who wears the name Rockhopper and has a black beard and  pirate hat. He considers himself a friend to everyone in Club  Penguin and would love to meet you too.</p>

To send a joke, poem, riddle or comic go to the last  page of the newspaper and follow the instructions. </p>
