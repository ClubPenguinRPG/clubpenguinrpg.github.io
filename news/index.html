<h1>New Surfing Level (and other new stuff)! </h1>
<div align="center"><img src="2007/06/surfingsurvival.jpg" alt="Surfing Game" width="500" height="289" /></div>
<p>Hello Penguins!</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already played it, a new surfing level was launched today!  It is a survival mode where you have to dodge the iceburgs while performing the tricks.  It is a  really fun way to play the game.  If you&rsquo;re not very good at the surfing game, we also added a new &ldquo;Surf Lesson&rdquo; where you can practice and get better!</p>
<p>In other news:  It looks like the storm is causing some of the sea animals to do some crazy things!  Be sure to check out the underground swimming pool for more details!  Also, be sure to check out the new cards that were launched today.  They are a lot of fun!</p>
<p>Until then&hellip;Waddle on!</p>

<h1>Cool New Stuff!  </h1>
<div align="center"><img src="2007/06/poll_screen.gif" alt="Poll Screen" width="503" height="353" /></div>
<p>Hello Penguins!</p>
<p>Today I wanted to highlight a couple of cool things we&rsquo;re adding.  Many of you have asked for it and so the official &ldquo;Club Penguin Poll&rdquo; has been added to the website home page.  If you haven&rsquo;t seen it yet, <a href="http://www.clubpenguin.com/">click here  to check it out</a>!  If you have ideas for future questions let us know, we&rsquo;ll be changing it at least once a week!</p>
<p>In other news:  It turns out, there are still some penguins that are having trouble with learning how to surf.  We wanted to make sure everyone enjoyed this new game so we&rsquo;re launching a &ldquo;Surf Lesson&rdquo; mode that will show you the basics on how to stay on the wave and how to do some of the tricks.  Hopefully this helps everyone get that much better at this fun new game!</p>
<p>Also, I can&rsquo;t give away too much, but the storm off the coast is going to start causing some trouble on Club Penguin Island this weekend.  Be sure to check it out and read the newspapers for more details!  The storm will also bring in a new level on one of the games, but I can&rsquo;t tell you any more than that.  You&rsquo;ll have to check it out on Friday!</p>
<p>Until then&hellip;Waddle on!</p>

<p>Also, as always, he will be bringing some cool new items from his recent voyage.  Be sure to check them out!</p>

<h1>Server Maintenance</h1>
<p>Hello Penguins!</p>
<p>Last night we had to upgrade some of our servers which caused Club Penguin to be down for a little while.  We apologize to those of you who were unable to play during that time.  We are always working hard to make sure that Club Penguin stays as fast as possible.  Thanks again for your patience!</p>
<p>In other news:  I&rsquo;ll post another update later today talking about some cool things happening in the next few weeks!</p>

<p>Hello Penguins!</p>
<p>Since we were all having so much fun with the Summer Party, we thought it would be great to do something special.  Instead of adding one new item like we planned, we decided to add two!  So we hope you all enjoy the last few days of this party and make the most of it because it ends on Monday. </p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t worry, I have heard rumors that a certain Captain might be returning to the island as soon as next week so stay on the lookout because you never know when he might arrive!</p>
<p>In other news:  We also launched some amazing stuff for your igloo today including new flooring, new furniture, and new music so be sure to check it out!</p>

<p>Hello Penguins!</p>
<p>Many of you have found the map, grabbed your hard-hats, and are helping with the construction of the stairway down to the Cove.  I have seen a lot of questions about when the Cove will be opened and I finally have an answer!  I have confirmed that the Cove will be open to everyone sometime next week!  As with every new room in Club Penguin, there is always more surprises in store.  I&rsquo;ve heard that one of them is a free item for everyone so make sure you&rsquo;re there!</p>
<p>In other news:  This weekend is one of the rarest parties in Club Penguin!  The &ldquo;Member Parties&rdquo; have only ever happened a few times before and for those of you who have never been to one, they are a lot of fun!  There will be a new item that will only be given away at this party so you won&rsquo;t want to miss it.  The location is a secret until the day it starts, but there will be signs up showing you where to go.  Trust me, the location will be one of the coolest parts of the party!</p>

One of them is Captain Rockhopper so for those of you who want to see what he would look like as a different color, now you can print it out and color him any way you want!  The next cool item is something many of you have asked for.  It&rsquo;s a two page guide that shows you how to draw a penguin!  Now you can create your own penguin artwork whenever you like.  It can be found by clicking on  the &ldquo;Fun Stuff&rdquo; button on the Club Penguin home page, or just <a href="http://www.clubpenguin.com/fun/index.html">CLICK HERE</a> to go there right away!

<p>Hello Penguins!</p>
<p>I hope you all enjoyed the Pirate Party!  It seems like it was a lot of fun and Rockhopper enjoyed hanging out with everyone. </p>
<p>Today marked the launch of another Clothing Catalog!  This one brings back some of last year&rsquo;s early summer styles and adds in some new formal wear for end of the school year dances or proms.  Be sure to check out the newest styles and maybe throw a dress-up party in your igloo! You can even play some &ldquo;jazz&rdquo; music on the stereo for added effect.</p>
<p>Until then... Waddle On!</p>

<h1>Exciting News!</h1>
<p>Hello Penguins!</p>
<p>Last week I gave some hints about some exciting upcoming events!  I wish I could tell you more right now, but I can&rsquo;t.  Make sure to check out this Thursdays newspaper to start getting even more info about what might be coming.  Its going to be a lot of fun!</p>
<p>In other news:  Captain Rockhopper has been so popular this party that he is having some technical difficulties.  He may be trying to talk to people, but it looks like he&rsquo;s just standing there.  If you see him and he doesn&rsquo;t say anything please don&rsquo;t take it personally.  It is a technical glitch we hope to have fixed soon.  Thanks for your patience!</p>
<p>More news coming soon!</p>
<p>Until then... Waddle On!</p>
