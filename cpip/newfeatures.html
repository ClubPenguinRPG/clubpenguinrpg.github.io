      <h3>COMING SOON:</h3>
        
       <p>For the past two years, we've been reading all of your ideas for improving
Club Penguin and while the team was building new servers, they also got to
work on some new features that many of you have been asking for.  We may not
have included all your great ideas yet, but with these new servers, we're
hopefully going to be adding a lot more of them!
 
          <br />
      <br />
          The team is working hard this month to make a few new features ready for the
end of May and we wanted those of you who are helping with CPIP to be the
first to hear about them and share your feedback.
 
          <br />
      <br />
          Over the next few weeks, the CPIP blog will be updated each week with info
about one of the new features planned for May. Your input will be a huge
help as the team will be working hard on the features.
 
          <br />
      <br />
          These new features are different than the content released on a regular
basis in Club Penguin like new games, rooms, parties or catalogs. The new
features will help with communicating with your buddies and will improve the
interface of a couple different functions.
 
          <br />
          <br />
       Read the [<a href="http://community.clubpenguin.com/cpip">CPIP blog</a>] for more info about each feature in the coming weeks.
