        <h3>WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT:</h3>
        
        <p>While we've all been busy testing the new servers, there has been a lot of work started on a new look for the website, and it's all part of the Club Penguin Improvement Project. </p>

        <p>The new look for the website launches on April 14. Check the CPIP blog for updates, and as always, your suggestions and feedback are very helpful.        </p>
                
       <h3>A BIT OF BACKGROUND:</h3>
        
        <p>We've been listening to the ideas and suggestions that many of you have shared over the past several months about how to improve Club Penguin and they have been a huge source of inspiration for the new website design.</p>
        
        <p>Many of you let us know that you'd like to see more art and an easier way to navigate around the site and that has been one of the main goals for the new design. After hearing from many of you that the new Club Penguin logo is better because it's more simple and clean, we wanted to continue in that direction with the rest of the site. Thanks for all your feedback about it!</p>
        
        <h3>SNAPSHOTS:</h3>
        
        <p>Below are a couple of snapshots to compare: On the left is our current Fun Stuff section, and beside it is a section from the new design called Community. Many of you have provided suggestions on how to make the Fun Stuff section more fun and here's a sneak peek of what the Community section looks like so far:</p>


        <div class="screenshots"><img src="images/screenshots_fun_stuff.jpg" border="0" alt="Fun Stuff"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/screenshots_community_new.jpg" border="0" alt="New Site"/></div>

        <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>Includes all the features of Fun Stuff that you're used to</li>
            <li>Includes access to the What's New blog</li>
            <li>Features new elements we've heard from you about including more banners and activities</li>
        </div>
        
        <p>This is just a start. Be sure to check out the <a href="http://blog.clubpenguin.com/cpip">CPIP blog</a> and share your ideas. And remember, the new site will be launched on April 14!</p>
