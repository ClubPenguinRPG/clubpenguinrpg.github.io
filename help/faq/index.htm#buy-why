          <h2>Payment Information</h2>
          <ul><li><p><strong>	<a name="method-accept" id="method-accept"></a>Which payment methods do you accept?</strong></p>
  <p>Club Penguin accepts  several different payment methods for membership purchases. &nbsp;These include  Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, SMS, cash, check, money order, or other bank transfer  methods. &nbsp;When you are making your purchase, a complete list of payment  options will be presented. </p>
    <p>
Please note: Payments sent directly to our offices will not be accepted.</p>
 </li>      
        
       <li> <p><strong><a name="be-secure" id="be-secure"></a>Will my payment information be secure?</strong></p>
        <p> When you make a purchase  on our site, your information is sent directly to your financial institution  for verification. None of your financial information reaches our servers.  Our secure certificate uses 256 bit encryption technology to ensure payment  security.</p></li>

               <li> <p><strong><a name="refund-policy" id="refund-policy"></a>What is your refund policy?</strong></p>
        <p> Memberships are  non-refundable.</p></li>

        
       <li> <p><strong><a name="currency" id="currency"></a>What currency do your prices reflect?</strong></p>
        <p> Our prices are in US  dollars.</p></li>
     
        
        <li><p><strong><a name="cost-other-currencies" id="cost-other-currencies"></a>How much does membership cost in other currencies?</strong></p>

        <h2>Membership Questions</h2>
 <ul><li><p><strong><a name="take-effect" id="take-effect"></a>How soon does membership take effect?</strong></p>
        <p> Memberships will be  activated as soon as payment is received. &nbsp;This will depend on the method  of payment chosen.&nbsp; <br />
            <strong>Credit Card:</strong> Memberships purchased using the Credit Card payment option are  activated instantaneously. <br />
            <strong>PayPal:</strong> If your PayPal account charges directly to a credit card, memberships are  activated within 1 day. &nbsp;If your PayPal account withdraws money directly  from your bank account (eCheck) it may take up to 10 business days for the membership to  be activated. <br />
            <strong>Mail:</strong> Purchases made by mail may take up to 4 weeks to process.</p></li>

        
        <li><p><strong><a name="buy-why" id="buy-why"></a>I paid for a membership, but the penguin still can't buy 
clothing items, why?</strong></p>
        <p> If you have just made a  payment, please log off and log back on again to activate your membership  status.&nbsp; If you still do not have  membership status, it is likely that your payment has not yet been received (see membership activation times, above).&nbsp; If the expected wait time has passed and you  still require assistance, please contact <a href="mailto:support@clubpenguin.com" >support@clubpenguin.com</a> and we will  be happy to help. </p>
        </li>

        
      <li>  <p><strong><a name="penguin-identity" id="penguin-identity"></a>When I become a member, do I get to keep  the penguin's coins and  identity?</strong></p>
        <p> Yes, as long as the same  penguin name is used when purchasing a membership, members will retain  everything they had as non-members.&nbsp;</p></li></ul>
        <div align="right"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div>
        
        
        <h2>Account Management</h2>
       <ul><li><p><strong><a name="transfer-my-membership" id="transfer-my-membership"></a>Can I transfer my membership?</strong>
        </p>
       <p> Memberships are  non-transferable.</p></li>

        
        <li><p><strong><a name="membership-package" id="membership-package"></a>How do I change my membership package?</strong></p>
        <p> If you currently have a  monthly membership, you must first cancel your recurring membership, and then  purchase the membership package of your choice. &nbsp;As long as you use the  same penguin name, the new membership period will be added to any remaining  membership time.</p>
        <p>If you wish to switch  your membership to an automatically recurring monthly membership, you must  first wait until your current membership term has expired to ensure that no  membership time is lost.</p></li>
        
        <li><p><strong><a name="method-payment" id="method-payment"></a>How do I change method of payment?</strong></p>
        <p> In order to have your  monthly membership fees charged to a different credit card, you must cancel  your membership, wait until the end of your membership period, then purchase a  new membership using the updated information. &nbsp;As long as you use the same  penguin name, none of your items will be lost.</p></li>
        
        <li><p><strong><a name="automatically-renew" id="automatically-renew"></a>Will my membership automatically renew?</strong></p>
        <p> The only time a  membership will automatically renew is when you choose the monthly membership  option, and then select the &ldquo;Credit Card&rdquo; method of payment from the list of  payment methods. &nbsp;This membership will automatically renew to ensure  uninterrupted service. &nbsp;You can cancel this membership at anytime. </p>
        <p>One month memberships  purchased through PayPal, SMS, and PayByCash do not automatically renew.</p>
        <p>Six and 12 month  memberships do not automatically renew, regardless of payment method.</p></li>
        
         <li><p><strong><a name="membership-expired" id="membership-expired"></a>My membership has expired! &nbsp;How do I renew my  membership?</strong></p>
        <p> To renew your  membership, please visit <a href="https://secure.clubpenguin.com/membership/" >secure.clubpenguin.com</a>,  and purchase the membership package of your choice for your account. &nbsp;As  long as you use the same penguin name, the penguin will not lose 
any of its items.  &nbsp;The penguin account will be exactly as it was before your membership expired. </p></li></ul>
        <div align="right"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div>
        
        
        <h2>Cancellations</h2>
        <ul><li><p><strong><a name="cancel-membership" id="cancel-membership"></a>How do I cancel my membership?</strong></p>
        <p> Membership cancellations  only apply to <strong>monthly</strong> memberships  purchased using a credit card. These memberships automatically recur each month  to ensure uninterrupted membership service.&nbsp;  You may cancel your membership any time, and you will still receive the  full membership period that you have purchased.</p>
        <p>If you wish to cancel  your membership, please visit <a href="http://play.clubpenguin.com/cancel.htm" >Cancel Membership</a>.  &nbsp;If your account has an active monthly  recurring membership, you will be shown an option to cancel.&nbsp; Please note that in order to cancel your  monthly membership, you will need the penguin name and password.</p></li>
        
        <li><p><strong><a name="cancellation-take-effect" id="cancellation-take-effect"></a>How soon will the cancellation take effect?</strong></p>
        <p>When you cancel your  membership, it will automatically expire at the end of the one month period you  have purchased. </p>
        <p>Please cancel your  membership more than 3 days before the next billing date, or your payment may  still be processed. You will not lose any membership time by canceling early.</p>
        <p>For example, if you purchase a membership on the 5th day of a  month, and then cancel your membership, (immediately or otherwise) you will be  charged one time only, and your membership will automatically expire on the 5th  day of the following month. </p></li>
        
       <li><p><strong><a name="only-see-renew" id="only-see-renew"></a>I am trying to cancel my membership, but I only see an  option to &ldquo;Renew Membership&rdquo;.</strong></p>
        <p> If you are attempting to  cancel your membership, and you only see the option to renew, it means that  your membership has already been cancelled, and will expire at the end of your  payment period.</p></li>
        
        <li><p><strong><a name="happens-after-cancellation" id="happens-after-cancellation"></a>What happens to the penguin's coins, clothes, etc. after cancellation?</strong></p>
        <p> If you cancel your  membership, the penguin&rsquo;s belongings will go into storage and will be  automatically retrieved when you re-subscribe.</p></li></ul>
