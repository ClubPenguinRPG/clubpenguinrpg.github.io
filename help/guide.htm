          <h2>Walking Around</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> To walk around, click where you want to go, and your penguin <br>
    will walk towards that spot. </li>
            <li>If your penguin does not move where you want it to go, there may be something in your way, like a piece of furniture or a snow bank. Try clicking in a <br>
    different direction to move around the obstacle.</li>
            <li> To move through a door or to enter a room, click on the door. </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Games</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> Club Penguin has within it several &lsquo;mini&rsquo; games that allow you to earn coins.</li>
            <li> Some games are single penguin games. This means that you can play these games by yourself. Some are multi-penguin games, meaning you play them with other penguins. </li>
            <li> To play a single penguin game, simply go to that game and click it to play. A screen will pop up that asks you if you would like to play; click yes or no. </li>
            <li> To play a multi-penguin game, click the game, and then click &ldquo;yes&rdquo; when it asks, &ldquo;Do you wish to play?&rdquo; You will get a spot in the next available game. When enough people are ready to play, the game begins. </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Penguin Coins</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> Club Penguin Coins are your currency for buying stuff. You earn coins by playing games inside Club Penguin. There are many different games to choose from: Mancala, Ballistic Biscuit, Astro Barrier, Bean Counters, Sled Racing, and many more. Playing any of these games will earn you coins as long as you finish the game.</li>
            <li> Coins cannot be purchased with real money, only earned within the game.</li>
            <li> Coins cannot be transferred from penguin to penguin. </li>
            <li> When you buy items, coins will automatically be deducted from your penguin account, and the item will be added to your inventory. </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Buying Items (Members Only) </h2>
          <ul>
            <li> If you are a member, you can spend your coins to buy items or<br>
    furniture for your penguin. </li>
            <li>To buy clothing and accessories, go into the Gift Shop and click on the catalog to shop for items to buy. Click &lsquo;Buy Now&rsquo; in the catalog for the item you wish to purchase. When you buy an item, it gets added to your inventory. </li>
            <li> Your penguin will not automatically wear the item you purchased. You must edit your penguin to wear your new clothing. </li>
            <li> To buy furniture for your igloo, please read the &ldquo;Edit Your Igloo&rdquo; section of the help document.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Customizing your Penguin (Members Only)</h2>

            <li> If you want your penguin to wear something you bought, you need to edit your penguin. To edit your penguin, CLICK on your penguin, or on the Edit button on the main menu. This will bring up your player card. </li>

            <li> To put a new item on, click the item in the menu. To take an item off, click the item on your character, OR click a new item to replace it. </li>

            <li> To change your penguin&rsquo;s color, select the lower tab of your player card. It will list all of the colors you own (you have to buy colors from the catalog in the gift shop). Click the color you want, and your penguin will change color.</li>
            <li> If you don&rsquo;t own any items, you won&rsquo;t see any listed. You can buy items at the gift shop with the coins you earn.</li>

              <p> e1 = Laughing face<br>
      e2 = Smiley <br>
      e3 = Straight face <br>
      e4 = Frown<br>

          <h2> Flooding the Chat</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> If you type too many messages in too short a time, you may get a message that says &ldquo;Hey! Stop flooding the chat!&rdquo;</li>
            <li> This simply means that you are sending too many messages at one time. Flooding the chat slows everybody else down. The server wants you to slow down, or your messages might get ignored. </li>
            <li> If you continue to flood the chat, you will get another warning. If you keep it up after that, you will get temporarily kicked off. </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Actions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> Your penguin can do certain actions &ndash; wave, dance, sit, and throw a snowball. To do one of the actions, click on the Actions icon &ndash; the sitting penguin (on the left side of your bottom menu). Then click on the action you want to do. </li>
            <li> If you want to sit down, click the direction you want to face in the action menu. </li>
            <li> You can also use quick keys to do actions. </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Secrets</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> There are many secrets hidden throughout Club Penguin. We could tell you more about them, but that wouldn&rsquo;t be any fun.</li>
            <li> Have fun finding them! </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Report a Penguin</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> To report a penguin, click their penguin, and then click the &ldquo;M&rdquo; icon on the far right to report the penguin.</li>
