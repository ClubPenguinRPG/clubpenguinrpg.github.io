	  <h2><strong>What is Club Penguin?</strong></h2>
	  <p>Club Penguin is a virtual world where children can play games, have fun and interact with each other. </p>
	  <h2>How does it work? </h2>
	  <p>Each player chooses a penguin, gives it an identity, and explores Club Penguin, interacting with other penguins by chatting, playing games, sending greeting cards, or using emotes (emotion icons) and actions (i.e. wave, dance, sit, walk or throw a snowball). By playing games, players earn virtual coins which they can eventually   use to buy clothing and accessories for their penguin or furniture for   their igloo.</p>
	  <h2>Who is Club Penguin for? </h2>
	  <p>Club Penguin is designed for 6-14 year olds, but is open to children of all ages. </p>
	  <h2>Why did you create Club Penguin? </h2>
	  <p>Chatting and gaming are the most popular online activities for children, yet most products are geared to older teens and adults. As parents of young children, we wanted to create a fun, online world we&rsquo;d be comfortable letting our own kids visit. </p>
	  <h2>Is it safe?</h2>
	  <p>As part of its  commitment to creating a safe online environment for children and their  families, Club Penguin employs a large number of highly trained, on site staff  to monitor activity and chat, and provide personalized player support. Club  Penguin also offers two chat options: </p>
	  <p><strong><u>Ultimate Safe Chat&nbsp;</u></strong>limits what users can say to a predefined menu of greetings,  questions and statements, as well as emotes, actions and greeting cards. When  it comes to chatting, these users can only see other Ultimate Safe Chat  messages. </p>
	  <p><strong><u>Standard Safe Chat&nbsp;</u></strong>allows players to type their own messages to other users. Every  message is filtered to allow only pre-approved words and phrases, and block  attempts to communicate a phone number or other personal information. </p>
	  <p>Although the filter is  continuously updated, comments that could be offensive to some players may  occasionally get through. In order to limit that and further protect the  security of participants, moderators monitor what&rsquo;s going on and receive player  reports of misconduct. An &ldquo;M&rdquo; icon on the upper, right-hand portion of the  screen reminds participants a moderator is available to help. Players who  engage in inappropriate behavior can be silenced or banned. </p>
	  <h2>I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about MySpace. How does Club Penguin compare? </h2>
	  <p>While both sites offer forms of so-called &ldquo;social networking&rdquo;, MySpace provides a forum for its users to post photos and other identifying personal information. Club Penguin strongly discourages the posting of any personal information and has a range of technological and human safeguards in place to ensure those details cannot get through. <strong>(See &ldquo;Is it safe?&rdquo;)</strong> </p>
	  <h2>Are my child&rsquo;s personal details safe with Club Penguin? </h2>
	  <p>Yes. Club Penguin has a strict Privacy Policy. We voluntarily conform to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor Principles and the Canadian Code of Practice.   </p>
	  <h2>Does it cost anything to join Club Penguin? </h2>
	  <p>Although anyone can enjoy Club Penguin free of charge, they won&rsquo;t have the same privileges as paying members, such as buying clothing or decorating their own igloo.  Memberships cost $5.95 per month, however, reduced rates are available with six-month or one year memberships. These can be purchased online with Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, check, money order, or through numerous pay by cash options. </p>
	  <h2>Why charge anything at all? </h2>
	  <p>Instead of financing our operations through advertising as most websites do, Club Penguin relies solely on paid memberships. Club Penguin is proud to be 100 per cent ad free.</p>
	  <h2>How is Club Penguin making a difference? </h2>
	  <p>A   portion of the proceeds  from each Club Penguin membership supports organizations that &nbsp;work on behalf of the world&rsquo;s youngest and  most vulnerable citizens. Our Kids Helping Kids program allows Club Penguin members to play a role in securing a happier and healthier future for other children around the globe. </p>
