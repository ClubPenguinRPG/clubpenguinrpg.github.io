                        <p align="left"><strong>Kelowna, British Columbia</strong> &ndash;Just one year after it launched, Club Penguin(<a href="http://www.clubpenguin.com" >www.clubpenguin.com</a>) continues to reach new milestones of success and garner kudos for the quality of its product and its work in improving Internet safety for kids.</p>
                        <p>The popular website that allows children to play games and chat in one of the safest online environments to date was recently chosen by Children&rsquo;s Technology Review (CTR) to receive its coveted Editor&rsquo;s Choice Award.</p>
                        <p>CTR is an independent monthly survey that reviews children&rsquo;s technology products from professional educators&rsquo; perspectives.</p>
                        <p>In a recent review of Club Penguin, CTR awarded the site 4.5 stars out of 5, saying, &ldquo;The experience is social and easy to play, and it offers a variety of informal learning opportunities. As a language experience, the program gets children busily typing with others, and there are a variety of games that require logical thinking and strategy. All in all, this is a noteworthy service.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gratifying to receive such a high rating from a publication that is a trusted source for unbiased and credible reviews of technology products aimed specifically at children,&rdquo; says Lane Merrifield of Club Penguin. &ldquo;Our sole focus at Club Penguin is the safety and enjoyment of our young users and we really value the support of other organizations that display a similarly strong commitment to children and families.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Since Club Penguin launched its virtual world populated by colorful, animated penguins in October 2005, it&rsquo;s experienced a rapid growth in popularity and reputation.</p>
                        <p>In March 2006, Club Penguin made its debut on Miniclip.com, the world&rsquo;s largest website dedicated to playing online games. A month later, Club Penguin was the number one game on the site, a position it has maintained ever since.</p>
                        <p>With concerns about online safety for children at an all time high, Club Penguin has also garnered favourable reviews for its commitment to protecting its young users.</p>
                        <p>Thanks to a sophisticated filtering system and the presence of live moderators who monitor what&rsquo;s going on in the world and deal with any reports of misconduct, Club Penguin offers unprecedented peace of mind for parents. It also adheres to a strict privacy policy and includes no advertising.</p>
                        <p>&quot;Although advertising certainly has its place in the world of adults, I don&rsquo;t think it belongs on a site dedicated to children,&rdquo; says Merrifield, a father of two. &ldquo;I wouldn't let my child watch an hour of advertising on TV. So why would I on theweb?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Club Penguin recently partnered with NetSmartz Workshop, a leading educational safety resource that teaches children and teens how to stay safer on the Internet.</p>
                        <p>The site was also selected by the Better Business Bureau&rsquo;s BBB OnLine program to receive its Kid&rsquo;s Privacy Seal of Approval, a respected designation currently held by less than a dozen other companies in the world.</p>
                        <p>Club Penguin is designed for 6-14-year-olds but is open to children of all ages. Although the site is funded by subscriptions, you don&rsquo;t have to be a paying member to visit or play games.</p>
